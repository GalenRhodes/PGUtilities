/**
 * A comparison function, which imposes a <i>total ordering</i> on some collection of objects.  Comparators can be passed to a sort method (such as
 * {@link Collections#sort(List, Comparator) Collections.sort} or {@link Arrays#sort(Object[], Comparator) Arrays.sort}) to allow precise control over the sort order. Comparators can also be used to
 * control the order of certain data structures (such as {@linkplain SortedSet sorted sets} or {@linkplain SortedMap sorted maps}), or to provide an ordering for collections of objects that don't have
 * a {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering}.
 * <p>
 * The ordering imposed by a comparator {@code c} on a set of elements {@code S} is said to be <i>consistent with equals</i> if and only if {@code c.compare(e1, e2)==0} has the same boolean value as
 * {@code e1.equals(e2)} for every {@code e1} and {@code e2} in {@code S}.
 * <p>
 * Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map). Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an
 * explicit comparator {@code c} is used with elements (or keys) drawn from a set {@code S}.  If the ordering imposed by {@code c} on {@code S} is inconsistent with equals, the sorted set (or sorted
 * map) will behave "strangely."  In particular the sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general contract for set (or map), which is defined in terms of {@code equals}.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose one adds two elements {@code a} and {@code b} such that {@code (a.equals(b) && c.compare(a, b) != 0)} to an empty {@code TreeSet} with comparator {@code c}. The second
 * {@code add} operation will return true (and the size of the tree set will increase) because {@code a} and {@code b} are not equivalent from the tree set's perspective, even though this is contrary
 * to the specification of the {@link Set#add Set.add} method.
 * <p>
 * Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators to also implement
 * {@code java.io.Serializable}, as they may be used as ordering methods in
 * serializable data structures (like {@link TreeSet}, {@link TreeMap}).  In
 * order for the data structure to serialize successfully, the comparator (if
 * provided) must implement {@code Serializable}.
 * <p>
 * For the mathematically inclined, the <i>relation</i> that defines the
 * <i>imposed ordering</i> that a given comparator {@code c} imposes on a
 * given set of objects {@code S} is:<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) &lt;= 0}.
 * </pre> The <i>quotient</i> for this total order is:<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) == 0}.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * It follows immediately from the contract for {@code compare} that the
 * quotient is an <i>equivalence relation</i> on {@code S}, and that the
 * imposed ordering is a <i>total order</i> on {@code S}.  When we say that
 * the ordering imposed by {@code c} on {@code S} is <i>consistent with
 * equals</i>, we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence
 * relation defined by the objects' {@link Object#equals(Object)
 * equals(Object)} method(s):<pre>
 *     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. </pre>
 * <p>
 * In other words, when the imposed ordering is consistent with
 * equals, the equivalence classes defined by the equivalence relation
 * of the {@code equals} method and the equivalence classes defined by
 * the quotient of the {@code compare} method are the same.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@code Comparable}, a comparator may optionally permit
 * comparison of null arguments, while maintaining the requirements for
 * an equivalence relation.

     * The implementor must ensure that {@link Integer#signum signum}{@code (compare(x, y)) == -signum(compare(y, x))} for all {@code x} and {@code y}.  (This implies that {@code compare(x, y)} must
